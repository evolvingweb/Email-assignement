[mailchimp-form.html](https://github.com/evolvingweb/mailchimp-assignment/blob/master/mailchimp-form.html) is the Mailchimp newsletter signup form, as copied-and-pasted from their admin UI. It's ready to be customized and embedded on your own site. We are including it for reference.

[homepage-form.html](https://github.com/evolvingweb/mailchimp-assignment/blob/master/homepage-form.html) is Evolving Web's customizations, as currently implemented at [http://evolvingweb.ca](http://evolvingweb.ca) homepage.

We want to improve this form in multiple ways.
* Expand the form with an additionnal city field when the user focus click the email fiel (see mockup below)
* This city field should be prefilled with the user city using Geoip
* If the user choose to type another city in the City field we should provide him autocompletion.
