# Email-assignement


Home-page-form.html is what we have currently. 

mailchimp-fullform.html is the Mailchimp form out of the box 

We want to improve this form in multiple ways.
* Expand the form with an additionnal city field when the user focus click the email fiel (see mockup below)
* This city field should be prefilled with the user city using Geoip
* If the user choose to type another city in the City fiel we should provide him autocompletion
