# Email-assignement


Home-page-form.html is what we have currently.

mailchimp-fullform.html is the Mailchimp form out of the box

We want to improve this form in multiple ways
1. Expand the form with an additionnal city field when the user focus click the email fiel (see mockup below)
2. This city field should be prefilled with the user city using Geoip
2. If the user choose to type another city in the City fiel we should provide him autocompletion
3.
